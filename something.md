test:

Hello I am writing text and I'm going to use brakets and parenthesis somewhat randomly in a way that I would normally write it.

here is random example of code 
```
public static void main(String[]){
    int[] something = {1, 2, 3, 4};
    System.out.println(something);
    [link inside the code thing](codingisfun.io)
}
```

and now here is an actual image link
