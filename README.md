# cse15l-lab-reports

- The repository for all of my CSE 15L lab reports. 
- the something.md is the page I'll be using for testing markdown files and the formatting on github pages.
- for screenshots, there will be a lab#ss folder for each lab report containing the screenshot image files.
- nothing else interesting to note here yet.
